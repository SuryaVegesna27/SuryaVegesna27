**Hi, I'm Surya Vegesna 👋**

👨‍💻 Data Science Enthusiast | 🎓 Master’s Student | Machine Learning Explorer 🧠

**About Me:**

When I was a child, I used to watch cricket and football, mesmerized by the data these games generated. I couldn't understand how all that information was managed, but I loved those scoreboards; they gave me a thrill. Fast forward to today, I handle large datasets on a daily basis. Now, I truly grasp how these numbers and metrics are critical in every business, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

My curiosity drives me to explore the patterns and trends hidden within data, while my attention to detail ensures that no insight is overlooked. As a data science enthusiast, I focus on leveraging machine learning and cloud technologies to solve complex business challenges. I believe that by understanding the smallest details, we can unlock impactful solutions that shape a better future.

**Recent Projects I Built**

I believe in learning through action, so I’ve created several impactful projects:

[Yelp Review Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/YelpReview_Sentiment-Analysis): Developed a sentiment analysis system using BERT to classify Yelp restaurant reviews using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project focuses on understanding customer sentiment and providing actionable insights for restaurant businesses based on review data.

[Mini Scholar AI](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Mini-Scholar-AI) : It is an AI-powered platform designed to simplify academic research by enabling efficient text extraction, semantic search, and summarization of research papers. It leverages state-of-the-art NLP technologies like Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, and ChatGPT API to deliver contextual insights and enhance productivity.

[Optimizing Walmart's Sales Strategy](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Optimizing-Walmart-Sales-Strategy-with-Predictive-Analytics) : Developed predictive models including Random Forest Regressor and Exponential Smoothing to forecast Walmart's sales, enabling effective stock management, revenue calculation, and investment decisions.

**Outside of Work:**

When I’m not immersed in data, I love playing cricket and badminton, **Capturing real-world scenes through my lens as a photographer**, or cooking Indian, Italian, and Middle Eastern dishes.
