Hi, I'm Surya Vegesna 👋
👨‍💻 Data Science Enthusiast | 🎓 Master’s Student | Machine Learning Explorer 🧠

About Me
I’ve always been fascinated by the stories data can tell. My curiosity drives me to explore patterns and trends, while my attention to detail ensures that no insight is overlooked. As a data science graduate student, I focus on leveraging machine learning and cloud technologies to solve complex business challenges. I believe that the key to unlocking impactful solutions lies in understanding the smallest details that shape the bigger picture.

Recent Projects I Built
I believe in learning through action, so I’ve created several impactful projects:

Churn Prediction: Built a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving, helping businesses take proactive actions.
Sentiment Analysis: Developed a system to analyze social media sentiment using NLP techniques, providing valuable market insights.
Outside of Work
When I’m not immersed in data, I love playing cricket and badminton, Capturing real-world scenes through my lens as a photographer, or cooking Indian, Italian, and Middle Eastern dishes.
