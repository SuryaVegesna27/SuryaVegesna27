**Hi, I'm Surya Vegesna üëã**

üë®‚Äçüíª Data Science Enthusiast | üéì Data Science Grad from GSU | Machine Learning Explorer üß†

**About Me:**

When I was a child, I used to watch cricket and football, mesmerized by the data these games generated. I couldn't understand how all that information was managed, but I loved those scoreboards; they gave me a thrill. Fast forward to today, I handle large datasets on a daily basis. Now, I truly grasp how these numbers and metrics are critical in every business, transforming raw data into actionable insights.

My curiosity drives me to explore the patterns and trends hidden within data, while my attention to detail ensures that no insight is overlooked. As a data science enthusiast, I focus on leveraging machine learning and cloud technologies to solve complex business challenges. I believe that by understanding the smallest details, we can unlock impactful solutions that shape a better future.

**Recent Projects I Built**

## [Mini Scholar AI](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Mini-Scholar-AI)  
Developed an **AI-powered research assistant** for academic papers, enabling **efficient text extraction, semantic search, and summarization**. Utilized **Sentence Transformers, ChromaDB, and ChatGPT API** to enhance productivity and streamline research workflows.

## [Airline Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Airline-Customers-Sentiment-Analysis-using-KeyBert-and-Llama2)  
Built a **customer sentiment analysis model** using **Llama2** and **KeyBERT** to extract insights from airline reviews. The system helps airlines understand passenger sentiment and improve customer service based on NLP-driven insights.

## [Image Classification using Distributed Learning](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Image-Classification-using-Distributed-Learning)  
Implemented an **image classification system** utilizing **distributed deep learning** techniques for scalability and efficiency. Leveraged **PyTorch and Horovod** to accelerate model training across multiple GPUs.

## [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://github.com/SuryaVegesna27/Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection_ImbalancedData)  
Developed a **fraud detection model** for imbalanced credit card transaction data using **SMOTE, Random Forest, and XGBoost** to improve fraud detection accuracy. Enhanced model interpretability with SHAP value analysis.

**Outside of Work:**

You‚Äôll find me on the cricket field, playing badminton, capturing real-world moments through photography, or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen.
